# Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

## Examples

Here is an example of a custom hook:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return { count, increment };
}
```
